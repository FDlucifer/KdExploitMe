KdExploitMe
===========

A kernel driver to practice writing exploits against, as well as some example exploits using public techniques.

The intent of this driver is to educate security testers on how memory corruption issues in Windows kernel drivers can be exploited. Knowing how to exploit security issues allows security testers to prove that bugs are exploitable which can be used to convince developers to fix bugs. While these techniques can be used for evil, I have written this driver in the hopes that you will use this knowledge for good.
